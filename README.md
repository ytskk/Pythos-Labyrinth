Over the years, the true meaning of the Pythos Labyrinth became a legend, whispered in whispers by those who heard of its existence. There were a few who believed in these legends and went to the Labyrinth, but no one returned in their right mind.

Now all the big ones are beckoned by the Labyrinth and the promise of finding the Eye of Python. Some are obsessed with destroying or subjugating the world, some want to unravel the secrets the Eye holds, some seek eternal glory, and some seek untold riches.

You will have to traverse the treacherous corridors of the Labyrinth, fighting powerful monsters and overcoming dangerous traps to get hold of the artifact. Can you succeed where all others have failed and take the Eye of the Python for yourself?
